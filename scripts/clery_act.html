        <h2>What is the Clery Act?</h2>
        <p> 
            The Clery Act was enacted in enacted in 1990 by Congress 
            to increase awareness of crime on college campuses after Jeanne Clery, a 19 year 
            old student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was raped and murdered 
            in her dorm room. Her parents said that if they were aware of the school's crime rate, 
            their daughter wouldn't have chosen to attend. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the enactment of this law, many universities have been found as non-compliant. 
            In 2021, the 
            <a href="https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2020-032.pdf">California State Auditor found</a>
            that only one out of the six California universities that they audited was fully 
            compliant with reporting crimes as required by the Clery Act. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Will add more information, like how the act requires universities to report crimes 
            in a certain manner and frequency.
