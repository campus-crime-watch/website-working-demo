        <i><h2> Why we made Campus CrimeWatch </h2>
        <p>
            As students, faculty, or staff of a college campus, we are bombarded with email or text notifications 
          about the latest crimes near or on campus, as mandated by the Clery Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to be informed about crime on campus, we want to feel safe at our place of work and residence. 
          A constant influx of texts and emails is a disorganized, ineffective way of getting a true idea of campus safety. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Some universities post their crime statistics buried in a 100-page yearly campus safety report, 
          which not many people read. Other universities post recent crimes on a non-user friendly map on their school website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted to create a centralized, accessible picture of crime and safety on the college campuses where we live and work.
